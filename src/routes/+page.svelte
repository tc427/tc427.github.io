<main>

I am a researcher in computational biohysics, and bioinformatics.
My work has centered on how biomolecules fold, and the effect their folding has on their properties.
I have worked on the folding of DNA, and proteins, bioinformatics analysis of large sequence datasets, and the analysis and simulation of SELEX experiments.
