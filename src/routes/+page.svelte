I am a researcher in computational biohysics, and bioinformatics.
My work centres on how biomolecules fold, and the effect their folding has on their properties.

<h2><a href="./research">Current projects</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li> Understand dynamic ensembles of biomolecular assemblies </li>
	<li> Cellular-scale molecular dynamics </li>
	<li> Integrated biophysical modelling: end-to-end representations </li>
</ul>
I have worked on the folding of DNA, and proteins, bioinformatics analysis of large sequence datasets, and the analysis and simulation of SELEX experiments.
