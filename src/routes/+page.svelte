I am a researcher in computational biohysics, and bioinformatics.
My work so far has centered on how RNA molecules fold, and the effect their folding has on their properties.
I have touched on other related topics: the folding of DNA, and proteins, bioinformatics analysis of large sequence datasets, and the analysis and simulation of SELEX experiments.
Some works have been mostly independent: participating in the development of a normal mode analysis webserver for proteins (webnma), a protein pocket identification software.
